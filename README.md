# Creating a private blockchain using Hyperledger Besu

This tutorial explains how to create a private blockchain using Hyperledger Besu with the IBFT 2.0 Proof of Authority consensus mechanism.

This repository will be creating a Private blockchain with 4 nodes (Because IBFT require minimum 4 nodes to operate).

In this 4 nodes one will be bootnode and others will be validators. We will be running besu from docker image for easiness.
## Requirements

- Docker
- Hyperledger Besu
